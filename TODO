can't add new class
what is const {auth} in navigationItems line 9
leacture 27 from the net ninja- route Guarding (can't we make middleware?)
leacture 26 didnt work 
why do I need to set the auth state in each component and can't call as Props
why I cant see the auth when I console log auth (it's a fuction)
book button component
avatar component
create user when register
delete session
when not auth- book and add lead to sign in
order list by date
remove sessions in the past
upload photos with crop
move the form in Login to form (in Login folder)
connect to FB
connect to google
add current players in session and replace it with minimum in sessionView
pass token when add session to get access from firebase 
refactor {
    in Login, change mapDispatchToProps to bind..
    fix states- more in redux
} 
map{
    in sessionInfo- the pin where the input address
    map section with all the pins- access to sessionInfo when click
}
account{
    my sessions- history and in the future
    change pic
}
style {
    newSession form
    Login
    sessionInfo
    sessionList- save the divs in the same place withpur matter the context
}
add edit sessionInfo
make the add button float one
chat in sessionInfo
notification
